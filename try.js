//First of all, initialize the sum i.e, sum = 0. 
//Start traversing the array. 
//As there is string of numbers at every even position of the array, so convert this string into integer and store in a variable value by using stoi function in C++. 
//As there is operator at every odd position, check if the operator is ‘+’ or ‘-‘. If it is ‘+’, then add the value to the sum, else subtract from the sum. 
//Finally, return the sum obtained.
